# Vshred Challenge

## Completed 11/7/2020

I have been using the Live Server extention on VSCode to develop and view the site, which is the easiest way to test out the design and functionality.

If you would like me to deploy the page somewhere on a real server so that you can test with Lighthouse, I would be more than happy to.

I just wasn't sure you'd like Vshred assets on a public site somewhere or not, so I chose not to deploy it anywhere without your go-ahead.
